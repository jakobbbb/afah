You: Good morning, kittys.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Oh you are finally awake.
Koschka: We are hungry.
You: What?
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Perhaps you did not hear me the first time so I will repeat it for you.
Koschka: Very slowly.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Us.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Cats.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Hungry.
You: I... I did hear you.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Then why are the food bowls empty?
You: You, um, you're right.
<<set $money = $money - (13*5)>>
<<feedcats>>
You: ...
You: I'll have to get some fresh air.

<<collectcats>>
You: Now my head is clear and my arms full of cats.
You: Splendid.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Yes, great.
You: Oh god. You are still talking.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Of course.
Koschka: Why should I have stopped?
You: Because... I mean, you're a cat, you never should have started!
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Ok, rude.
You: ... sorry.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Apology accepted.
You: But why are you talking now?
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: I talked to you yesterday.
You: You what... ah yes I remember. I though I just imagined it because I was so tired.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: I noticed.
Koschka: You were fast asleep when I left for work.
You: When you what? 
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Where did you think all that money came from??
You: I don't know.
You: I didn't really think about it.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: We noticed.
Koschka: We also noticed that you aren't able to take care of yourself.
Koschka: Which is why we all pitched in. 
Koschka: Well not all of us.
Koschka: The ones who can actually keep a job.
You: That feels like thinly veiled criticism.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Good.
<<playsound Door>>
Doorbell: *dingdong*
You: Oh god, who is this now?
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: The neighbor.
You: How do you know that?
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Even you should be able to recognize the footsteps.
You: No, I am not.
Koschka: ... 
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Anyways they probably want to complain about the smell...
You: Oh no. I need more cat litter.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: ...and the noise.
You: I have to buy some.
    -> Buy cat litter. 
        <<set $money = $money - (3*20)>>
You: I can feel a migraine coming on.
You: I have to go to bed.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Well, suit yourself. 
You: Good night, kittys.
<<playsound Meow_1>>
Koschka: Ugh.
Koschka: Some of us have to work, you know?
