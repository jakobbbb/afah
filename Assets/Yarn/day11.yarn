Koschka: Good morning.
You: I need to get more cats.
Koschka: Why tho?
You: Do you not want me to be happy?
You: And prove to everyone that I can actually do thing?
Koschka: And you think that's the way to do it?
You: Yes.
Koschka: Okay.
You: I knew you would understand me.
Koschka: I just don't like to argue.
Koschka: Especially with the person who feeds me.
You: Oh you are right, here's your food.

You: Mooooore cats.
Doorbell: *dingdong*
You: Oh no, that's the neighbor again.
Koschka: Correct.
You: I will just ignore them.
You: ...
Koschka: Well here comes someone you can't just ignore.
Doorbell: *dingdong* 
You: What do you mean?
Koschka: Listen.
Neighbor: I already tried that. They won't answer the door. Just like yesterday.
Friend: That is concerning!
Friend: *knocks*
Friend: It's me!
Friend: Please open the door!
You: Oh no.
Friend: *knocks*
Friend: Please!
Friend: I am so sorry.
Friend: I'm sorry I yelled at you
Friend: I was a real ass.
Friend: And I am really sorry for that.
Friend: I was just so overwhelmed.
Friend: And hurt. Even though I know that you are not doing that stuff on purpose.
Friend: You need my help and not me being angry at you for being unwell.
Friend: Please answer me!
Neighbor: And me! These cats are keeping me up at night!
Friend: ...really? I am trying to have a heartfelt conversation here. 
Frien: And also can you not just use earplugs?
Neighbor: I have sensitive ears!
Friend: *knocks*
Friend: Please, are you okay?
You: Um...
-> I'm fine.
-> Go away.
-> I don't have problems sleeping.
    Neighbor: I know, I can hear you snoring every night.
Neighbor: See, they are alive,so you got nothing to worry about.
Friend: Can you please open the door?
You: ...
You: No.
Friend: *sighs* okay.
Friend: But know that I am always there if you need me.
Friend: And I worry about you.
Neighbor: And I worry about my sleep.
You: I cannot anymore.
You: I'm going to bed.
Koschka: Whatever makes you happy.
