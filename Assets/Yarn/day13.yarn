Koschka: Do you really not think that you have a problem?
You: Huh?
-> No.
-> No?
-> Definitely not.
Koschka: Well if you say so.
Door: *dingdong*
Officer: Hello, district veterinary office, please open up!
You: *whispers* Oh no.
Officer: We received an animal welfare complaint at this address.
You: *whispers* The neighbor.
Officer: Hello, is anyone there?
You: ...
-> No.
-> Meow.
-> *silence*
Officer: Hello? 
Officer: I have to inform you that I will return with police force if necessary.
Officer: And by necessary I mean if you do not cooperate.
Officer: And by cooperate I mean open the door.
You: ...
-> Meow.
-> Meeooowww.
-> *silence*
-> Fuck off.
Officer: Okay, but you have been officially informed and I will put an informational leaflet in your letterbox.
You: ...
-> Meow.
Officer: Why am I still working this job?
Officer: ...
Officer: I should have become a circus clown like my parents wished.
You: Oof, that was close.
Koschka: You won't be able to dodge the fuzz forever.
Koschka: These institutions are excerting the power that the governement holds over society.
Koschka: But not only them.
Koschka: Other institutions that may seem like they have nothing to do with political power.
Koschka: They also maintain power in the hands of a certain social class and exclude the instruments of another social class.
You: ...
You: Where did that come from?
Koschka: I watch a lot of Youtube videos.
You: Fair enough.
You: So we just have to destroy all institutions to be truly free?
Koschka: Probably? 
You: Because they are after me.
You: And won't stop until they have destroyed me.
You: They don't want me to be happy.
Koschka: Uhm, that's not what I said?
You: I will think this over in the morning.
You: Good night, kittys.
Koschka: ...
Koschka: Well, even I am now truly worried.
